  # Wrapper for the eval() builtin function to evaluate expressions and

  # that object literals are really evaluated to objects. Without the
  # wrapping, they are evaluated as block, and create syntax
  # errors. Also protects against other syntax errors in the eval()ed
  # code and returns null if the eval throws an exception.
