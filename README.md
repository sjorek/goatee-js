## Meaning

For those who like acronyms:

> [G]oatee - a [O]bject [A]ccessor [T]emplate [E]ngine [E]ngine

And yes, the word “engine” occurs deliberately twice, as goatee is recursive :-)

## Objective

First of all a citation from the originating
“[google-jstemplate](http://code.google.com/p/google-jstemplate/)” project:


> Template processing is the staple pattern for separation of data and
  presentation in web applications. But it usually works on one page at
  a time, which is inadequate for incremental, asynchronous page updates
  typical of Ajax applications.

> This system provides templates that allow for …

> - **incremental processing**: every processing operation produces valid output

> - **differential processing**: output text is again a template.

> It also fixes other undesirable properties of standard template processing:

> - **Wellformed output** is guaranteed.

> - **Escaped** by default.

> - Templates are intelligible: **input template is valid output**.

> And, of course:

> - Pure javascript, HTML, browser side processing.

That's what goatee is all about. So what's the difference between “goatee”,
“[google-jstemplate](http://code.google.com/p/google-jstemplate/)” or other
similar projects like “[knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com)” then ?

The answer: My goals. I promise that “goatee” will have …

- … html4, html5, xhtml 1.1, and xhtml5 flavours,

- … an extremly modular architecture,

- … an interpreter during development-phase, with quick'n'dirty instant updates,

- … small and fast pre-compiled bytecode for production-releases,

- … no external dependencies and no name collisions in browser environments with
  popular frameworks as jquery, underscore and so on,

- … all the features of
  [google-jstemplate](http://code.google.com/p/google-jstemplate/),

- … implementations for the following platforms:
  - Express.js (Node)
  - Slim Framework (PHP)
  - Symfony Framework (PHP)
  - TYPO3 Flow (PHP)
  - Django (Python)
  - Rails (Ruby)
  - Grails (Groovy)
  - Playframework (Java/Scala)

- … 100% compatiblity for all runtimes in all those different languages,
  producing exactly the same results, no matter if it runs in on the client
  side (browser) or on the server side,

- … content-management-extensions with the same look and feel as well as
  behaviour, no matter which implementation has been choosen, and with
  versioning for all contents and assets,

- … a very low learning curve, because it's just javascript with css-philosophy
  combined. Which means you won't have to learn a new syntax or grammar.

## Installation

Goatee is not yet installable, but some components are …

- [goatee-script](http://github.com/sjorek/goatee-script)
- [goatee-rules](http://github.com/sjorek/goatee-rules)

## Usage

Goatee is not yet useable, but some components are … see above.

## Development

    $ git clone https://github.com/sjorek/goatee
    $ cd goatee
    $ PATH=$PATH:./node_modules/.bin cake all

## Credits go to …

- … Steffen Meschkat for meeting me back in 2004 and sharing all his passion and
  knowledge avout his (sadly proprietary) perl-based content-managment-system,
  which still is my main motivation behind this project.

- … Google Inc. and especially Steffen Meschkat and all the other contributors
  for their [google-jstemplate](http://code.google.com/p/google-jstemplate/)
  as a source of motivation and inspiration

- … Jeremy Ashkenas and all contributors for their
  [Coffee-Script](http://coffeescript.org/)

- … [Nodeclipse v0.4](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1)
 ([Eclipse Marketplace](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/nodeclipse), [site](http://www.nodeclipse.org))
